## 📚 What I Learned (5-Minute Summary)

**Main Topic:** Cloud Computing Fundamentals

**Key Takeaways:**
1. The cloud is basically renting computers and infrastructure over the internet instead of owning them.
2. There are three service models - IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS - and the deeper you go down the stack, the more control you get.
3. The benefits of cloud come down to flexibility, cost savings, scalability, and not having to babysit physical hardware.

**New Terms:**
- **IaaS**: Infrastructure as a Service - renting servers, storage, networks (think sandbox-level control).
- **PaaS**: Platform as a Service - renting a pre-built environment to deploy apps without managing the server itself.
- **SaaS**: Software as a Service - fully managed apps you log into and use

## 🛠️ What I Built

**Exercise/Project:** Cloud Service Model Comparison Mini-Guide

**What I did:**
- Outlined the three cloud service models
- Broke them down by level of control vs responsibility


**Commands Used:**
```bash
# No CLI commands used today
```

**Result:** A solid mental framework and a reusable mini-guide I can reference forever

**Screenshots:** No - this was concept + foundations

## 💡 Key Learning

**One thing I'll remember from today:**
The cloud is not magic. It's someone else's computer, but optimized, distributed, scalable, and on demand.

**How I'll use it:**
* As the base layer of every project in this 90-day journey
* To make smarter cost vs control decisions when I start deploying real infrastructure
* To talk confidently about cloud models

## 🐛 Problems Faced

**Problem:** Cloud terminology overload (I swear the industry is 80% acronyms :joy:)  
**Solution:** Reframed every term into "what does this actually mean in real life?" language
**Lesson:** Understanding beats memorizing - always
